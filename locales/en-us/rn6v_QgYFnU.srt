00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,945
I've got two terminals open and both are located in the blog project.

2
00:00:04,945 --> 00:00:10,835
Let's run git log in this one and git log --oneline over here.

3
00:00:10,835 --> 00:00:13,755
The line holds the information for just one commit.

4
00:00:13,755 --> 00:00:15,800
It's the first seven characters of the Shaw,

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,554
and then the commit message.

6
00:00:18,554 --> 00:00:20,890
Here's the Shaw for the most recent commit.

7
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,719
And here's the same commit with the full Shaw.

8
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:26,629
See how the first six characters are the same.

9
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:28,919
This commit here is this one.

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,595
And here's the second commit.

11
00:00:30,594 --> 00:00:32,185
And here it is over here.

12
00:00:32,185 --> 00:00:34,135
So nothing has changed in the repo.

13
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:38,780
The --oneline flag just alters the way the information is displayed.

14
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,899
It's a pretty helpful command,

15
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,000
if you want to quickly review a repository's commits.
