00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,352
It's worth doing a quick recap of how we expect the parameter this to behave.

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:08,050
Again, it's almost exactly like an input parameter.

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,770
But rather than being bound to the value that is supplied between the parens,

4
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:14,390
it's bound to the value that's on the left of the dotted call time.

5
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:18,314
So this function is going to log first ob1 and then ob2.

6
00:00:18,314 --> 00:00:21,586
Here are the call time parens and this is the binding for

7
00:00:21,586 --> 00:00:24,490
the first positional parameter.

8
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:29,180
And here we have the call time dot and the binding for the parameter this.

9
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,340
Back in our example, these are the call time parens.

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,610
There's nothing being passed in and bound to positional parameters and

11
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,840
here we have the call time dot and the binding for the parameter this
