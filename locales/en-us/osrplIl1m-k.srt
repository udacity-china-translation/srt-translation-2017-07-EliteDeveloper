Hi Charlie, what are you up to?

2
00:00:02,625 --> 00:00:06,929
Oh, hey Philip, I was just looking up something about mixture models on Wikipedia,

3
00:00:06,929 --> 00:00:11,029
but somehow I ended up learning about Norwegian blue parrots.

4
00:00:11,029 --> 00:00:13,304
I'm not really sure how I got there.

5
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:17,250
I know that feeling. It's easy to get distracted when you are exploring Wikipedia.

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,679
A funny thing that I found in my explorations is that if I go

7
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:22,379
from page to page by clicking the first link in each article,

8
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:25,574
I eventually find myself at the philosophy article.

9
00:00:25,574 --> 00:00:27,539
That's weird.

10
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,224
I wonder if that will happen every time.

11
00:00:29,225 --> 00:00:30,860
I'm going to try it out.

12
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:34,219
I'll click on the first link on each Wikipedia page I come to.

13
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:36,195
So, here's what I'm doing.

14
00:00:36,195 --> 00:00:41,234
Let me start at some Wikipedia page like the article for African swallow.

15
00:00:41,234 --> 00:00:44,189
I suppose I could have used the random article feature

16
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:46,489
if I didn't have this topic in mind already.

17
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:51,020
Now, I'm going to click the first link I come to in the main part of the article.

18
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:55,600
I'll skip the disambiguation link and head to the article proper.

19
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,679
That takes me to the article for bird.

20
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:03,209
The first link here is endothermic.

21
00:01:03,209 --> 00:01:07,400
So, I can keep going on like this for quite a long time.

22
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,775
The first link in this article takes me to ancient Greek,

23
00:01:11,775 --> 00:01:16,150
and the next step is Greek language.

24
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:19,015
From there, I get to modern Greek.

25
00:01:19,015 --> 00:01:22,390
Here, the first link is a pronunciation help link.

26
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,635
I think it's a good idea to skip over that.

27
00:01:24,635 --> 00:01:26,760
It's not taking me to another article,

28
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,640
just teaching me how to say modern Greek in modern Greek.

29
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,724
The first link to another article is colloquially.

30
00:01:34,724 --> 00:01:36,359
After that comes word,

31
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:40,310
and then linguistics, and then scientific.

32
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:43,230
These articles are getting more and more abstract.

33
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:46,650
The first link in this article is knowledge,

34
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,020
and that leads to awareness,

35
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:52,664
and then quality which is a philosophical term.

36
00:01:52,665 --> 00:01:56,310
So eventually, I make it to Philosophy.

37
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,359
So, the process is go to

38
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:03,390
a Wikipedia page and find the first ordinary link in the main part of the text.

39
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,775
Click through to the new page and repeat the process.

40
00:02:06,775 --> 00:02:08,950
Keep going until you reach philosophy,

41
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:13,079
which seems to happen pretty often or until you get tired of clicking.

42
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,005
Let's try the process again.

43
00:02:15,004 --> 00:02:17,004
Hmm, where should I start?

44
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:18,719
Why not the chair article?

45
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:21,330
The first link in the article is here, the word furniture.

46
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,025
And the first link in the furniture article takes me back to chair.

47
00:02:25,025 --> 00:02:27,629
So not every article chain makes it to philosophy.

48
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:30,090
Instead, some chains make loops.

49
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,865
We can try this with some other articles to see what happens.

50
00:02:32,865 --> 00:02:34,885
All this clicking is a bit slow though.

51
00:02:34,884 --> 00:02:37,204
This is something we can automate with Python.

52
00:02:37,205 --> 00:02:41,760
It's surprising how often I find that everyday tasks can be made better with programming,

53
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:43,560
and it will give us a chance to practice

54
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,000
everything that's happened in this course so far.
