1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,630
So, that idea for how to rank webpages is

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:05,670
the same idea as how we measure popularity of people.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,820
But instead of thinking about friendships as the way

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,420
to measure popularity, what we're measuring is links on the

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,230
web. When one page has a link to another

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,030
page, well that indicates it's more likely that this other

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:23,560
page is popular, just like when someone is a friend,

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,550
it indicates that the person they are friends with is

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,920
more likely to be popular. So, the goal in ranking web

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,030
pages is to get a measure of how popular are pages,

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,810
based on the other pages that link to it but we

12
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:38,150
have the same issue with popularity then not all links are

13
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:42,940
the same. That a link from a page that's really important

14
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,710
counts for a lot more than a link from a page

15
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,950
that is not important. So, if the New York Times has

16
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,950
a link to your page, that counts for a lot more than

17
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,690
if your mom sets up a web page and puts a

18
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:55,160
link to your page in it. Unless your mom is Lady

19
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,460
Gaga, in which case her link probably counts for more. So,

20
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,630
another way of thinking about this is what we're trying to model

21
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:05,080
is a random web surfer. So, our random web surfer has

22
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,170
some set of pages that they know about. And those pages

23
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:11,720
have links to other pages. Some pages might have a lot

24
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:16,170
of links. Some pages might just have one link. Some pages might

25
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,010
have no links. So, one way to think about this

26
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,140
is that we're trying to model a random web surfer. The

27
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,720
web surfer starts knowing about some pages. And she picks

28
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,060
one page at random, let's say she picks this page. And

29
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,360
then, when she's on that page, she picks a random

30
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,950
link and follows that links. Whoops, this was a bad starting

31
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,700
page. It actually has no out links. So, then, she picks

32
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,590
another random page. Let's say she picks this one. She follows

33
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,870
the link from that page, and now she got to the

34
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:47,270
page with no links again. Let's say she picked a better starting

35
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:50,150
point. Let's say she randomly picked this one. Now she's got

36
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:53,460
two links to follow. She randomly picks one of those. She follows

37
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,510
it. She gets to a new page. She randomly picks a

38
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:59,640
link from that page, in this case, it only had one, and

39
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,300
in this case, it seems we have a bit of a

40
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:06,400
problem, because all of the starting pages eventually lead into this one,

41
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,050
which has no outgoing links. So, we'll think about how to

42
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,700
solve that problem later, but we can think of what our

43
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,180
random web surfer is doing, is picking random pages, following links,

44
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,570
and what we want to measure is the popularity of a page.

45
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:22,690
And that's the probability that she reaches that given page, starting

46
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:26,170
from these random pages. So, if you did this over and

47
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,440
over again, and you counted the number of times you reached

48
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,290
each page, that would give you a measure of that page's popularity.

49
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:36,020
So, this is very similar to the popularity function. We're

50
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,150
going to define a function that we'll call the rank of

51
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,930
the page. And, like the way we defined the popularity

52
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,060
function, it's going to have two inputs. It's going to have a

53
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,010
time step, and it's going to have the page which we'll

54
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:51,980
use a URL for. And the output of rank will

55
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,030
be some number. Except for we'll define for time step

56
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,370
zero. This is our base case, and we're going to find all

57
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:00,680
the ranks have value one. We'll actually change

58
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,090
that shortly, but we'll start out think of it,

59
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,780
all the ranks having value one, like we

60
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,400
did with the popularity scores. And then we'll define

61
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:15,230
the value of the rank at time step t for any given URL. Just like we defined

62
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:19,200
the popularity score. It's going to be the sum of

63
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,420
all the pages that are friends with this page,

64
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,200
and what it means for our webpage to be friends

65
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,660
with another page is that it has a link to it.

66
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,940
So, this is going to be for all the pages that

67
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:33,150
exist that have some link to that URL, or its friends.

68
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,670
And so, we're going to go through each of those pages.

69
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:40,390
We'll call them inlinks instead of friends. We're going to go through

70
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:43,170
those and we're going to sum up the ranks that we got

71
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:47,460
for those pages at time t minus one. So, this is

72
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:51,820
our first model of popularity on, of webpages. This is exactly

73
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,380
the same as the model we had of popularity for people.

74
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,460
It's not going to work that well yet and one of the

75
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,980
reasons it's not going to work that well is some pages

76
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,530
might have lots of links. And if a page has lots

77
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,090
of links, the value of each one of it's links should

78
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,090
be diminished. It shouldn't have the same value as the page

79
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,510
that only has one link that links to this URL. Maybe that

80
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,850
should be the same case for a friend's popularity, if

81
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:19,670
someone has lots of friends, each friend is less valuable.

82
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,459
Whereas someone who only has a small number of friends

83
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:23,850
has lots of time for each friend. So this is the

84
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,330
way we're going to model web popularity. We don't want

85
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:29,090
to just give the same score to each link. We're

86
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:32,860
going to change this by dividing by the number of outlinks.

87
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:37,700
So, if a page has many outgoing links, the value to

88
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,880
the pages that it links to is less for each page. So,

89
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,700
a page that's just a long list of lots of links won't

90
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,710
have that much influence on the rankings. If a page only has

91
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,430
a few outgoing links, well then, they are worth more. So, what are

92
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:52,290
going to do, is divide this by the number of out links from

93
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:55,550
p. So, each of the p pages, right? These will be the

94
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:59,329
values of p, as they go through the inlinks of URL. We

95
00:04:59,329 --> 00:05:02,779
are going to sum up the rank that we got on the previous time

96
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:05,840
step and divide that by the number of out links.
