1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,800
And answer is the second choice. It is also

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,240
true that there's a small town in Virginia named

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,910
Alta Vista. But the relevant answer is the second

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,660
choice. Back in 1998, the most popular search engine was

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,650
probably the search engine called AltaVista. They certainly had

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,070
the biggest web index at the time. And they also

7
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,300
had great technology for responding to queries quickly. 1998

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,440
is the year that Google was founded, and most people

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,410
probably have not heard of AltaVista today, and, might

10
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,990
have had a hard time answering this quiz. And

11
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,950
the reason for that is Google figured out a

12
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,200
better way to do page ranking. And because of this,

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,490
search engines that didn't have good ways of ranking

14
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:42,740
pages, like AltaVista, quickly become irrelevant. And the algorithm

15
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,120
that I've described, is the algorithm that launched Google.

16
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,560
It's called PageRank. And you may think the Page stands

17
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:55,730
for webpage. The Page actually stands for Larry Page, who was

18
00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:00,980
the co-founder with Sergey Brin, of Google. So, that's the algorithm

19
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,940
that we've described. And that's what allowed Google to produce so

20
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,810
much better search results, than other search engines at the time.

21
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:11,530
>> I hope you remember Anna Patterson from Unit Three, and are still following

22
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,570
her advice to be polite on the web. One of the reasons AltaVista started to

23
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,320
work so badly, was because websites were not polite. They

24
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,760
tried to find ways to gain the rankings. Certainly this

25
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,250
is still something websites still do today. And the way

26
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,900
AltaVista ranks pages, it was very easy to gain them, so

27
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,630
the site that would be ranked was not the best

28
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,000
site about something, but a site that was best at gaining

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,250
the rankings. So I asked Anna to explain why Google's

30
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,640
page ranking algorithm was so important to the success of Google.

31
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:39,719
>> So a page rank on the web, was a huge step forward.

32
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,760
I'm old enough to actually remember the time

33
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:47,590
that Google launched and you know, it's advance over

34
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:51,790
AltaVista. Was AltaVista was very, very prone to keyword

35
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:54,620
stuffing spam. So if you said restaurant 32 times,

36
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,760
well you were better than a page that

37
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,200
said restaurant twice. So, PageRank came out and actually

38
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,750
gave a measure of popularity or traffic, and therefore,

39
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:06,590
the things that said restaurant twice, but were awesome.

40
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,085
They wound up going to the top.

41
00:02:09,085 --> 00:02:11,560
>> Certainly things have got more complicated since then, and there's

42
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,810
more things that go into the ranking algorithm, than just what we've

43
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,490
shown you. But that's the basic idea, and the next thing

44
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:20,310
we're going to do, is change our search engine to implement this algorithm.
