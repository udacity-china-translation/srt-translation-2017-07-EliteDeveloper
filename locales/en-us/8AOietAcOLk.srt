00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,379
Hey, well done on your work.

2
00:00:02,379 --> 00:00:04,459
Yeah, you've done a great job.

3
00:00:04,459 --> 00:00:08,445
You have used tuples and practice using default arguments in your functions.

4
00:00:08,445 --> 00:00:11,550
You also learned to read data from a file and how to

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,080
input modules from the standard library and third party libraries.

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,405
You practiced using the Internet to figure out programming questions and problems.

7
00:00:19,405 --> 00:00:22,315
This sounds simple but this is a really important skill.

8
00:00:22,315 --> 00:00:24,540
I never program without using the Internet.

9
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,000
In the next section,

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,039
we'll be working through a case study together.

11
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:30,000
We'll be practicing a lot of the skills we've

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,450
discussed so far. It should be a lot of fun.
