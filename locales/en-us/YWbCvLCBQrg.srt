00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's apply our knowledge of HTML to a real page.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,924
Here's a Wikipedia article.

3
00:00:04,924 --> 00:00:07,349
I'll use my browser to see its source.

4
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:10,814
I'm using Google Chrome but every browser has a view source button.

5
00:00:10,814 --> 00:00:13,504
It just might not be in the same place as it is in Chrome.

6
00:00:13,505 --> 00:00:17,085
This HTML isn't as tidy as the example we looked at before.

7
00:00:17,085 --> 00:00:21,685
Unlike Python, HTML doesn't require indentation or organization.

8
00:00:21,684 --> 00:00:24,714
If you scroll through it though we can see some familiar tags.

9
00:00:24,714 --> 00:00:28,664
Here's a paragraph, some divs and some anchor tags.

10
00:00:28,664 --> 00:00:31,394
Let's switch back to the rendered version of the page.

11
00:00:31,394 --> 00:00:35,515
Okay, the first link in the page is this link to the Monty Python article.

12
00:00:35,515 --> 00:00:37,649
Let's try to find that in the source code.

13
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:41,219
Here it is. It looks like the article's text begins right here.

14
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,199
This link is inside a paragraph tag,

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,005
but I can't really tell if the paragraph tag is inside of any other tags.

16
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,920
There's just too much unformatted HTML for me to read.

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,230
Fortunately, browsers have tools to make this manageable.

18
00:00:53,229 --> 00:00:57,384
I want to close this source code tab and open the developer tools.

19
00:00:57,384 --> 00:01:00,134
These developer tools aren't unique to Chrome.

20
00:01:00,134 --> 00:01:02,424
Every browser has something similar.

21
00:01:02,424 --> 00:01:05,808
Okay, now we have an organized view of the HTML.

22
00:01:05,808 --> 00:01:08,524
I can right click the first link and choose Inspect.

23
00:01:08,525 --> 00:01:10,535
Then the tree of elements in the Tools panel

24
00:01:10,534 --> 00:01:13,744
expands to show the hierarchy of tags that lead to the link.

25
00:01:13,745 --> 00:01:17,945
It looks like the first link is this anchor tag which is inside of this paragraph tag,

26
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:19,634
which is inside of this div.

27
00:01:19,635 --> 00:01:23,420
The div's ID is mw-content-text.

28
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,655
It looks like that div is inside of a chain of a few more divs.

29
00:01:26,655 --> 00:01:29,555
Excellent, if every article is structured like this one,

30
00:01:29,555 --> 00:01:32,250
then we should be able to use this information to do our web crawler.
