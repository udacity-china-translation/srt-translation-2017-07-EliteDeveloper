1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,120
So before we get to the problem of ranking web

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,270
search results, I want to talk about one more interesting recursive

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:09,250
definition, the fibonacci series. And fibonacci numbers are one of

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,440
the most interesting things in mathematics. Once you know about them,

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,170
you'll see them all over the place, both in nature

6
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:18,040
and in human designs. The name comes from Leonardo da

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,090
Pisa who was also know as fibonacci. And back in

8
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,372
1202 he published a book called Liber Abaci. The root Abaci

9
00:00:25,372 --> 00:00:27,812
is the same as the one for abacus the calculating

10
00:00:27,812 --> 00:00:32,020
machine. And this translates loosely as book of calculus. This

11
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,530
was the book that introduced Indian mathematics to the west.

12
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,740
In particular it introduced what we now know as Arabic

13
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,360
numerals. This replace the Roman numeral system that was then

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,130
widely used. And part of what fibonacci did in the

15
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,975
book was show, how much easier it is to do

16
00:00:45,975 --> 00:00:50,490
calculations, using numbers in the decimal systems where the place,

17
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,270
where the number is indicates its value. And as part

18
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,810
of the book introduce these problems, and showed how to

19
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:59,420
solve them using calculation. The problem that became known as

20
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,650
the fibonacci numbers was one of the problems in the book.

21
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,430
And he posed a problem like this. So at the

22
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,290
beginning, we have one pair of rabbits, and it takes

23
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:11,810
one month for a rabbit to produce offspring, and every

24
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:15,300
month a mature rabbit will produce a new pair of rabbits,

25
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,730
so at month one, we had one pair of

26
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:22,290
rabbits. At month two, well, we have the one pair

27
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,780
we started with. And now we have a new pair.

28
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,280
We have two pairs of rabbits. And now at month

29
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,850
three the baby rabbits aren't yet ready to produce offspring.

30
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:34,240
It takes a month for the rabbits to reach maturity.

31
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,530
But these two will produce new offspring each month. So

32
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,460
we have one new pair of baby rabbits and the

33
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,590
rabbits that were born in month two, well they've had

34
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:47,160
a month to get bigger. So now, they're mature rabbits.

35
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,930
So we had three pairs at the end of month

36
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,650
three. So month four we still have the three pairs of

37
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:55,360
rabbits we had, rabbits never die in this model, and

38
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,320
the two pairs that are mature, both of those will now

39
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,180
produce new rabbits. So we have two new pairs of

40
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,850
baby rabbits. The baby rabbits that were born in month three,

41
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,610
well now those are mature. So now we have

42
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,630
three pairs of mature rabbits, and two pairs of baby

43
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,830
rabbits, so we have five pairs of rabbits total. And

44
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,370
this keeps going, so the model assumed that rabbits never

45
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,820
die, that every month each pair of mature rabbits

46
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,690
produces a new pair of rabbit babies. And it takes

47
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,060
one month for a pair of rabbits that spawn, to

48
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,880
become mature. So in month five, the three mature pairs

49
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:36,010
of rabbits, will all produce new offspring. New offspring,

50
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:39,230
new offspring, three new offspring. And the two that

51
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,910
are a month old, that were born in month

52
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,020
four, now become mature. So this isn't a very

53
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:47,870
accurate model of how rabbits reproduce. It's good for

54
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,770
us, if it was an accurate model, it would

55
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,270
only take a few years for rabbits to control

56
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:56,570
the entire planet. But it's an interesting mathematical model.

57
00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:00,280
And the model that this poses, we can write in

58
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,570
a more formal way. So, the number of rabbits is

59
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:06,080
the number of rabbits we had in the previous month,

60
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,750
since those rabbits don't want to die. So in month five,

61
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,710
we have the five pairs that we had in the

62
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:14,770
previous month, plus all of the rabbits that were mature, meaning,

63
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:18,320
all of the rabbits that we had, two months ago,

64
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,980
which was three if we're on month five while those reproduce.

65
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,470
So we have three new pairs of rabbits, plus

66
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,730
the five that we have in the previous month. And

67
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:30,546
this keeps going. So we could in month six, we're

68
00:03:30,546 --> 00:03:33,580
going to have the eight rabbits that we had at the

69
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:37,805
end of month five, plus the five mature pairs,

70
00:03:37,805 --> 00:03:40,800
one, two, three, four, five, will each reproduce. So we'll

71
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,570
have five new pairs, and that will give us 13

72
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:48,780
pairs of rabbits. So this was the model fibonacci developed.

73
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,790
And the question is, can you figure out, at the end

74
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,052
of month n, given any number n, how many rabbits will

75
00:03:54,052 --> 00:03:56,790
there be? So the way we define this mathematically is a

76
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:00,850
little different from the way, fibonacci posed the question. And that's

77
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:05,550
because in modern mathematics, we usually like our series to start

78
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,680
with a zero. If we are thinking of modeling rabbits, well

79
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,400
that doesn't quite make sense to start with zero rabbits. But

80
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,760
if we're thinking of it as a more general series, it does.

81
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,570
So the way it's defined mathematically is that

82
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:19,769
we say that the fibonacci number zero, is defined

83
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:24,610
as zero. Fibonacci number one is defined as one,

84
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,080
and those are our two base cases. So this

85
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,170
is different from the other recursive definitions we've seen

86
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,850
in that the two base cases. Previously, all of

87
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:35,600
our definitions just had one base case. And then

88
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,920
we can define every other fibonacci number, but first

89
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:43,500
we'll be starting from these base cases. And so, the fibonacci number n,

90
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:49,740
where n is some whole number greater than one, is, well we

91
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,340
have all the rabbits in the previous month. So, that's fibonacci of n minus 1,

92
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,040
plus, all the new babies. And the number of new

93
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,290
babies is the number of rabbits we had two months

94
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:02,080
ago, those are all the mature rabbits. That gets added

95
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,390
to the number of rabbits we had the previous month.

96
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:08,520
So that's how we define fibonacci numbers. This defines every fibonacci number

97
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,330
in terms of the two base cases, and in the one recursive case.

98
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,540
So, your goal is to define a procedure called fibonacci.

99
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,190
That takes a natural number as input. So, numbers starting

100
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,470
from 0, any whole number 0 or higher, and outputs

101
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:30,530
the value of that fibonacci number, defined using this recursive definition.
