1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,959
We're using git to keep track of our projects.

2
00:00:02,959 --> 00:00:04,753
Now that's great for working locally,

3
00:00:04,753 --> 00:00:07,574
but to be able to share this local repository with others,

4
00:00:07,575 --> 00:00:09,300
we'll need another tool.

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,554
The tool we'll be using is GitHub.

6
00:00:11,554 --> 00:00:15,820
GitHub is a service for hosting version control repositories.

7
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,304
Now even though their names are very similar,

8
00:00:18,304 --> 00:00:21,420
git and GitHub are quite different.

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,219
Git is the tool you use to manage

10
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:27,094
the repository and you use git primarily on the command line.

11
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:32,274
Now GitHub is the hosting service which you typically interact with inside your browser.

12
00:00:32,274 --> 00:00:36,015
We'll send a copy of our local repository up to GitHub.

13
00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:38,413
This copy is not on our local machine,

14
00:00:38,412 --> 00:00:41,169
so it's called a remote repository.

15
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,905
The main commands we'll be looking at in this lesson are:

16
00:00:43,905 --> 00:00:46,978
git remote - to manage the remote repository,

17
00:00:46,978 --> 00:00:50,129
git push - to send changes up to the remote,

18
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,200
and then we'll be looking at git pull which will

19
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,200
retrieve updates from the remote repository.

20
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,509
These commands, push and pull,

21
00:00:57,509 --> 00:00:59,185
might not make a lot of sense at first,

22
00:00:59,185 --> 00:01:02,530
but think of these from the standpoint of your local machine.

23
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:07,831
You've got changes in your local repository that you want to be in the remote repository,

24
00:01:07,831 --> 00:01:10,468
so you'll push the changes to the remote.

25
00:01:10,468 --> 00:01:14,548
But if there are changes on the remote repository that you want in your local one,

26
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:18,019
you need to pull those changes down.

27
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:20,969
So these are the three commands we'll be looking at in this lesson.

28
00:01:20,968 --> 00:01:25,000
Let's start out by digging into what a remote repository actually is.
