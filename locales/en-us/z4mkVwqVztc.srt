1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,345
This is a fork.

2
00:00:02,345 --> 00:00:04,675
This is the noun form of the word.

3
00:00:04,674 --> 00:00:06,794
When we talk about forks in version control,

4
00:00:06,794 --> 00:00:09,129
we're not talking about this.

5
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:12,620
We're talking about the verb or action version of the word.

6
00:00:12,619 --> 00:00:15,089
Let's say you're out hiking on a trail and all of a sudden,

7
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:17,399
it splits into two paths.

8
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:21,929
We'd say that the road forked into two different paths.

9
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:24,059
So, that's the verb form of the word.

10
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:25,919
In the version control world,

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,520
forking is a split,

12
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,655
but it's an identical split.

13
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:34,285
To fork a repository means to split it into an identical copy.

14
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,228
Now, forking is not a Git thing,

15
00:00:36,228 --> 00:00:38,600
you can't run git fork on the command line.

16
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,132
There's no fork subcommand.

17
00:00:41,131 --> 00:00:44,040
It's something provided by the hosting environment.

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,539
GitHub is our hosting environment,

19
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,085
so GitHub has a fork button that lets you fork a repository.

20
00:00:49,085 --> 00:00:52,620
If you're on a repository's page on GitHub and click the fork button,

21
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:57,140
you make a copy of that repository and bring it over to your own account.

22
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,880
So this is what it means to fork something: make

23
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,000
an identical copy and become the owner of that copy.
