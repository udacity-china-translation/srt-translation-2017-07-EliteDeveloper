1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
This code has the functionality that was specified for

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,030
each of the cases where the program should stop calling Wikipedia.

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:12,970
There's an IF or an ELIF statement with a print statement and a return statement.

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,260
If none of those cases apply, we return true.

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,950
This is my code and it definitely isn't the only way to make it work.

6
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:22,734
Your answer might be different and that's fine.

7
00:00:22,734 --> 00:00:25,879
There's one place where I'd like to make an improvement to this code.

8
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:31,079
Here, I wrote the limit of 25 steps as part of the IF statement.

9
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:35,049
If I wanted to change the maximum number of steps allowed in the future,

10
00:00:35,049 --> 00:00:39,634
I'd have to find this line in the code and change it manually to another value.

11
00:00:39,634 --> 00:00:42,640
This kind of thing is called a magic number.

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,564
That just means a value included in the code with no explanation.

13
00:00:46,564 --> 00:00:52,530
It's better to avoid using magic numbers and instead encode such a value in a variable.

14
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,770
This way the meaning of the number is much clearer to

15
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,275
somebody reading the code and it's easy to replace it if needed.

16
00:00:59,274 --> 00:01:00,869
To remove this magic number,

17
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:04,829
I'm going to add a new argument to continue_crawl function,

18
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:06,640
the maximum number of steps allowed.

19
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,969
I'll call it max_steps.

20
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:12,230
I want to keep the functionality exactly the same as before.

21
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:15,420
So I'm going to give max_steps a default value of

22
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,579
25 and I'll replace the 25 in the code with max_steps.

23
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:24,734
Now, if Philip wants to use a different number of steps he can easily change it,

24
00:01:24,734 --> 00:01:25,799
when he calls the function.

25
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,418
But IF just uses two arguments,

26
00:01:28,418 --> 00:01:31,000
my default value of 25 will be the limit.
