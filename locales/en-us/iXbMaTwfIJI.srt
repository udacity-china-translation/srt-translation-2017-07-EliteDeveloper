00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,532
Great job setting up your computer to use GIT.

2
00:00:02,532 --> 00:00:07,405
Going through this lesson you laid a solid foundation to start learning version control.

3
00:00:07,405 --> 00:00:11,490
We looked at the benefits of version control and how incredibly helpful it can be.

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,595
You also looked at the terminology that version control systems use.

5
00:00:14,595 --> 00:00:18,025
And you did download the terminology document, right?

6
00:00:18,024 --> 00:00:21,974
It'll be extremely helpful to have on hand as you go through the remaining lessons,

7
00:00:21,975 --> 00:00:26,355
and last you installed GIT and got everything configured. Fantastic work!

8
00:00:26,355 --> 00:00:28,469
Really, a lot of people get bogged down with

9
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:30,859
all this stuff and never actually learn version control.

10
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:32,729
So congrats on getting this far.

11
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:36,059
Now let's head to the next lesson to learn how to create a GIT repository.
