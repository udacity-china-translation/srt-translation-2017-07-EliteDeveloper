1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,940
Our local repository has five commits,

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,969
and the remote one has the six commits.

3
00:00:05,969 --> 00:00:10,803
The local repository has the origin/master branch point to e,

4
00:00:10,804 --> 00:00:14,445
but in the remote the master branch is actually one commit ahead of

5
00:00:14,445 --> 00:00:18,940
e. Since the remote's master is pointing to commit seven,

6
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,530
these two repositories are out of sync.

7
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,839
We need to sync our local one with what's up on the remote.

8
00:00:24,838 --> 00:00:29,908
To do that we'd run "git pull," the name of the remote,

9
00:00:29,908 --> 00:00:34,954
in this case "origin," and then the branch to pull, "master".

10
00:00:34,954 --> 00:00:36,710
This will pull down the commits on

11
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:41,495
the origin's master branch and merge them into our local master branch,

12
00:00:41,494 --> 00:00:43,089
which just moves it forward.
