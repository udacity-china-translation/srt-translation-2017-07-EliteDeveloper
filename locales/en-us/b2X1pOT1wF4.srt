1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,440
So we want to dive in a little deeper on this idea of code reuse.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,300
And in order to do so,

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,680
we should really define what we mean when we say code reuse.

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,440
Well, when you're writing software,

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,440
reuse of code is the practice of writing generalized code

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,340
that can be relied upon to address a variety of different goals.

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:22,280
Now, whenever you notice that two parts of your code have similarities,

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,875
there's an opportunity to factor out the similar aspects of it

9
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:28,280
into some reusable library code so

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,400
that you won't have to repeat yourself in either of the two original places.

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,760
So here's an example we can use to think about code reuse.

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,760
Imagine you wanted to write a simple game that involves cars driving

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,800
along a street.

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,840
The player is on the run from a crime syndicate and

15
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,210
has to avoid their goons, who drive around in these unmarked vans.

16
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,490
Our program is going to need to keep track of a lot of data about each of

17
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:53,738
the entities moving around the system, and so

18
00:00:53,738 --> 00:00:56,341
we'll use object-oriented techniques a lot here.

19
00:00:56,341 --> 00:00:59,259
Now that we know what we're shooting for, let's put these mockups away and

20
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:00,910
focus on the code that we're going to write.
