00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,899
So far, we've been working on figuring out the steps that should be included in

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:06,035
our code and code it up to continue

3
00:00:06,035 --> 00:00:09,439
Crawl Function to control when the while loop should end.

4
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:13,349
My next job is to work from the contents of that while loop.

5
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:16,410
I'll transcribe the full steps we ordered earlier into

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,000
comments in the body of the loop then, at the actual code.
