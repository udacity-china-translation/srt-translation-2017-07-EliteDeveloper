1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,174
After creating a new repository,

2
00:00:02,174 --> 00:00:05,400
we're presented with this quick setup page.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,740
The first thing we see is that we can choose either the HTTPS URL or the SSH version.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,754
Clicking on the SSH version changes this URL here and then these URL's down here.

5
00:00:15,755 --> 00:00:18,495
We're just going to switch back to HTTPS.

6
00:00:18,495 --> 00:00:20,820
If you want any information about the SSH URL and

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,210
how to work with all that, check below the video.

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,900
The next section down here is what to do with a new repository.

9
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:31,409
We have an existing repository which will look at in just a second.

10
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,570
But if you want to create your remote repository on GitHub you can do that first,

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,310
and then you'd follow these commands.

12
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:42,195
So this first line would create a README file with a simple heading,

13
00:00:42,195 --> 00:00:43,859
then you'd initialized git,

14
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:46,260
add that README file, commit it,

15
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:50,869
and then create a link to this remote repository.

16
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:53,459
We're not going to be looking at the new repository section

17
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,929
since we already have an existing repository, so let's check that out.

18
00:00:56,929 --> 00:00:59,070
Now if you notice these two lines right here are

19
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,865
the exact same one as these two lines right here.

20
00:01:01,865 --> 00:01:03,420
So when you start with a new repository,

21
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,775
you have these initial commands to run and then you run these lines right here.

22
00:01:07,775 --> 00:01:10,800
If you already have an existing repository you would just run these lines right here.

23
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:11,819
So this first line,

24
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:14,743
it creates a connection to the remote repository upon GitHub.

25
00:01:14,743 --> 00:01:18,096
We'll look at pushing in the next section,

26
00:01:18,096 --> 00:01:22,000
but for now, just copy the top line and run it in your terminal.
