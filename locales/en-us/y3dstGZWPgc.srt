00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,984
Nice work so far. You're starting to get to know

2
00:00:02,984 --> 00:00:06,333
Python syntax and use data types including integers,

3
00:00:06,333 --> 00:00:08,322
booleans, floats, and strings.

4
00:00:08,321 --> 00:00:10,574
You've called some of Python's built-in functions,

5
00:00:10,574 --> 00:00:13,574
compared values, and assigned values to variables.

6
00:00:13,574 --> 00:00:17,214
All of these goals will be useful as you continue to learn and program in Python.

7
00:00:17,214 --> 00:00:19,905
Next, you'll start to write your own programs,

8
00:00:19,905 --> 00:00:22,920
complete with functions and conditional statements.

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,330
We'll see you in the next section.
