1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,320
Instead of referring to the parameter this, which gets bound to a new value

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,220
every time move is invoked, we could instead refer to the closure variable obj.

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,060
Each time we call the Car like function, a new closure scope is created and

4
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:17,270
therefore the obj variable will always refer to exactly one Car object
