1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,180
I'm on a course collaboration travel plans

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:07,589
repository that I forked from Lam's project here.

3
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:09,675
Now, I want to make some changes on my local machine,

4
00:00:09,675 --> 00:00:10,920
so I need to clone that down.

5
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:13,219
So, let's get the cloneable url.

6
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,900
And now, we can switch over to the terminal and clone this project.

7
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:18,899
So, I'm going to run git clone and

8
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:22,695
paste in the url to this repository to clone this down to my machine.

9
00:00:22,695 --> 00:00:26,370
Now, the CD into the project.

10
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,385
And now, I'm going to switch over to my code editor to make some changes.

11
00:00:29,385 --> 00:00:31,344
Before we switch to the code editor,

12
00:00:31,344 --> 00:00:35,700
let's switch to a new branch so that all of our changes will be added to that branch,

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,995
instead of the master branch.

14
00:00:37,994 --> 00:00:42,823
So, I've switched to a new branch called 'include-richards-destinations'.

15
00:00:42,823 --> 00:00:45,489
I want mom to come with me to my destinations,

16
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:48,740
so I'm going to add those here to her project.

17
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,510
I'm going to add these as three different commits because we're going to

18
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:54,853
be using those three separate commits later in the course.

19
00:00:54,853 --> 00:01:01,259
So let's scroll down here and I'm going to add Florida to this list.

20
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:11,030
And now to add the styling for Florida over here.

21
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:14,710
So, I have these two sets of changes, let's commit them.

22
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:17,219
Before committing, I always like to run

23
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:19,700
a quick git diff to make sure I'm adding everything.

24
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,635
So, let's run git diff.

25
00:01:21,635 --> 00:01:24,670
I've got the Florida css changes and

26
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:28,674
then the Florida html changes. Everything looks good.

27
00:01:28,674 --> 00:01:33,920
So, let's add these files and then commit them.

28
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,189
Now, let's have the destination to Paris.

29
00:01:36,189 --> 00:01:39,599
Copy the html over here and edit the I.D.

30
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,349
to Paris and edit the actual heading to Paris,

31
00:01:43,349 --> 00:01:51,514
then I'll copy the styling and update this to Paris and change the background color.

32
00:01:51,515 --> 00:01:54,329
Save this file and save this file and then,

33
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:56,640
back to the terminal to make another commit.

34
00:01:56,641 --> 00:01:59,882
Let's check the diff for this Paris change.

35
00:01:59,882 --> 00:02:01,365
So, we have the css file.

36
00:02:01,364 --> 00:02:03,140
We have these changes, the html file,

37
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,269
we have these. Looks great.

38
00:02:05,269 --> 00:02:09,944
So, I'll add these changes and then, I'll commit this.

39
00:02:09,944 --> 00:02:12,704
And finally, let's add the destination to Scotland.

40
00:02:12,705 --> 00:02:15,160
So, copy the html one more time,

41
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:19,840
changes to Scotland, change the heading to Scotland.

42
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,344
Now, change the css over here,

43
00:02:22,344 --> 00:02:27,034
change this to Scotland and then changing the background color.

44
00:02:27,034 --> 00:02:30,503
Now, let's save the css file and save the html file,

45
00:02:30,503 --> 00:02:34,844
and back to the terminal one last time. Let's run get diff.

46
00:02:34,844 --> 00:02:37,585
We've got the css change and the html change.

47
00:02:37,585 --> 00:02:43,045
Awesome. So, I'll add these files and then I'll commit them.

48
00:02:43,044 --> 00:02:47,278
Let's take a quick look at the git log.

49
00:02:47,278 --> 00:02:49,180
We can see that our new

50
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:53,995
'include-richards-destinations' branch is up here while the master branch is down here,

51
00:02:53,995 --> 00:02:59,370
but especially the remote origin master branch is right here on this commit.

52
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,985
So, both of these are on this commit while our new branch is up here.

53
00:03:02,985 --> 00:03:04,870
So, we just need to push this branch up to

54
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,730
our remote repository to get these commits on the remote.

55
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:13,579
So, let's push to the origin remote this branch.

56
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:19,440
I'll enter in my username and then my password.

57
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:24,764
That created this new branch up on the remote repository.

58
00:03:24,764 --> 00:03:26,156
Let's check that out.

59
00:03:26,157 --> 00:03:29,590
I'm on my remote repository on the master branch.

60
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:33,145
Now, I need to switch over to the other branch that I just pushed,

61
00:03:33,145 --> 00:03:35,640
so that we can see those changes.

62
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:38,469
Now, I can look at the index file and then,

63
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:42,865
here are the changes that I've added- the destinations that I've added.

64
00:03:42,865 --> 00:03:44,439
Now, if I check out Lam's project

65
00:03:44,438 --> 00:03:47,500
her remote repository and scroll down in the index file,

66
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,439
we'll see that those changes are not added there.

67
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,519
So, when I pushed,

68
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,000
my changes only went to my project, not to hers.
