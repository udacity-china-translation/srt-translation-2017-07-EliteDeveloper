00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,650
Rather than providing an input variable as a name for

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:05,140
that argument, we can use the parameter this.

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,740
It's very important to observe that there's exactly one of

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,650
these move functions in existence.

5
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:13,640
And it is being pointed to by the move property of multiple different cars in

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,230
addition to the global variable.

7
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:18,410
So what object do you expect the parameter this in the move function to

8
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,740
be bound to when this last line of code is executed?
