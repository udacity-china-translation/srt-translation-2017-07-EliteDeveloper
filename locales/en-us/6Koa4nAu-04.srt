00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,519
Understanding what a remote repository is and how to get and send changes to one,

2
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:08,099
is at the heart of working collaboratively.

3
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:11,459
We looked at GIT remote to manage a remote repository,

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,966
GIT push to send the changes,

5
00:00:13,965 --> 00:00:18,030
GIT fetch to retrieve updates and GIT pull to

6
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:23,554
retrieve updates and automatically merge those changes into a local branch.

7
00:00:23,554 --> 00:00:26,734
Now that we have the solid foundation of working with remotes,

8
00:00:26,734 --> 00:00:30,000
let's start working with another developer's repository.
