00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,609
Okay, that was easy.

2
00:00:01,609 --> 00:00:05,680
But what if the maker function had returned a function object instead of

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,760
a plain object?

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,660
Would you expect the two results to be the exact same function object or

5
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,200
would they be two different objects.
