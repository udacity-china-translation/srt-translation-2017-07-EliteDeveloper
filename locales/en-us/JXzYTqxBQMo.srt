00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,790
The answer is that even though the same exact line of code was used to

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:08,200
generate the two different objects, they are themselves different objects.

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,940
Changes you make to one object will not have any effect on

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,160
the other object because they have different identities.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,860
They are as different as two real world identical twins.

6
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:20,410
Identical twins look the same, but certainly each one has its own identity.

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,980
The two objects even start out by having all the same properties, but

8
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,720
no matter how similar they are in structure they will

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,970
always be two different objects their whole life.
