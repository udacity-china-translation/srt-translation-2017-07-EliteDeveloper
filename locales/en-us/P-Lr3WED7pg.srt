00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,679
So far, you've been working on a tame version of Python inside the Udacity classroom.

2
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:06,599
But in time, you're going to need to be able to run

3
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:10,154
Python scripts and experiment in the Python interpreter on your own computer.

4
00:00:10,154 --> 00:00:12,179
So it's installation time. Ready?

5
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,490
Go for it.

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,820
Python is a popular open-source programming language.

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,890
Open-source means that it's free to download, change, and use.

8
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:25,140
And the fact that it's already popular means there are online instructions to

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,664
help you get it installed for most common operating systems.

10
00:00:28,664 --> 00:00:31,494
Because it's popular and open-source,

11
00:00:31,495 --> 00:00:34,896
there's a large global community working on developing Python.

12
00:00:34,896 --> 00:00:37,003
For you, as a Python user,

13
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:39,780
that means there will be new versions coming out as

14
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,399
Python is improved by the community. Should we try this one?

15
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:48,039
Okay. You might find yourself needing to update Python from time to time,

16
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:50,979
especially if you're collaborating with other people as you write

17
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:54,294
Python programs that are compatible with the version of Python they're using.

18
00:00:54,295 --> 00:00:56,350
Next, we'll introduce you to the Python we're

19
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,679
using so that our code is compatible with yours,

20
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:02,600
and we'll help you make sure you've got it up and running correctly. Need a hand?

21
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:08,447
Yes please. One, two, three.

22
00:01:08,447 --> 00:01:12,000
Okay. We've got this one installed. Now it's your turn.
