00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,609
Let's say we have this GIT repository,

2
00:00:02,609 --> 00:00:07,740
but we realized that these last few commits are all minor changes, like typo fixes.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,253
It would make for a much cleaner GIT log,

4
00:00:10,253 --> 00:00:13,500
if these commits can be combined to do just one commit.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,339
We could run GIT rebase - i head till the three to

6
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:22,324
combine or squash the last three commits into one.

7
00:00:22,324 --> 00:00:25,513
Remember that head points to the current location.

8
00:00:25,513 --> 00:00:27,745
For us, were on the master branch,

9
00:00:27,745 --> 00:00:29,594
so head points to master.

10
00:00:29,594 --> 00:00:33,009
Head till the one is one before head,

11
00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:35,594
and is the previous or parent commit to the one wrong.

12
00:00:35,594 --> 00:00:38,625
Head till the two is two before head,

13
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:40,408
and is the grandparent commit.

14
00:00:40,408 --> 00:00:44,204
Head till the three, you guessed it is three before head,

15
00:00:44,204 --> 00:00:47,059
and is the great grandparent commit of the commit we're on.

16
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,599
Now we don't want to get rid of commit eight,

17
00:00:49,598 --> 00:00:51,464
that head till the three points to.

18
00:00:51,465 --> 00:00:53,925
But this is the GIT rebase command,

19
00:00:53,924 --> 00:00:55,919
so we're using head till the three as

20
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,405
the base that the other commits will be placed on two.

21
00:00:59,405 --> 00:01:00,570
This can be a little tricky,

22
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,730
so the easiest way to remember it,

23
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,004
is that if you want to squash,

24
00:01:04,004 --> 00:01:05,789
let's say 17 commits,

25
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,660
just use that number- 17 in this example as the number,

26
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:12,284
so it will be head till the 17.

27
00:01:12,284 --> 00:01:15,959
So running GIT rebase - i head till the three will take

28
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:20,609
the commit were on and the previous two and let's us squash them into one.

29
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:22,469
This creates a new commit sha,

30
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:25,799
and it moves the master branch to point to this new commit.

31
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:29,939
Notice though now, that no branch is pointing to the original permits,

32
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:31,629
so they won't appear in a GIT log,

33
00:01:31,629 --> 00:01:34,379
and GIT will eventually completely erase them.

34
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:37,933
Now if you're worried about damaging your repository and want a backup, well,

35
00:01:37,933 --> 00:01:42,500
then creating a backup is actually what you've got to do. Let's start over for a second.

36
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:47,025
When I rebase, I just create a branch conveniently called backup,

37
00:01:47,025 --> 00:01:50,680
that I place at the same location as the branch I'm rebasing.

38
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,830
I'm still on master, so I haven't checked out

39
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:56,840
the backup branch and I'll just run the same command.

40
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,680
This squashes the commits into one,

41
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,320
and moves master to point to this new commit,

42
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:06,194
but the original commits haven't been deleted and will still appear and get log,

43
00:02:06,194 --> 00:02:08,340
because a branch is pointing at them.
