1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,599
We have this setup where the remote repository has commits that the local one does not.

2
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:08,175
We can use git to fetch those commits.

3
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:11,400
Now, if we run git fetch origin master,

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,290
it will retrieve all of the commits on

5
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:19,574
the origin's master branch and move the origin/master tracking branch to point to them.

6
00:00:19,574 --> 00:00:23,419
And that's it. It doesn't make our local master branch move.

7
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:28,470
If we want the commits that are in origin/master to be in our local master branch,

8
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:30,224
then we just do a merge.

9
00:00:30,225 --> 00:00:32,579
If we're on the master branch then running

10
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:38,000
git merge origin/master will update our local master branch.
