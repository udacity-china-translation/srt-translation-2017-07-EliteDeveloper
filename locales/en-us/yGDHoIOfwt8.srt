00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
Now that we've written all the parts of the Wikipedia crawler,

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,750
let's see if they work together.

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:07,519
I'll start the program and see what happens.

4
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:08,830
Hmm, OK.

5
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:12,199
The program is running but it isn't printing anything quite yet.

6
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:14,695
I guess it's doing the crawling first and printing at the end.

7
00:00:14,695 --> 00:00:21,945
Let's wait.

8
00:00:21,945 --> 00:00:25,149
Oh, great.

9
00:00:25,149 --> 00:00:27,969
It's done, and it looks like it worked.

10
00:00:27,969 --> 00:00:32,534
We got from the Big Four British railway companies to Philosophy.

11
00:00:32,534 --> 00:00:35,971
But you know, waiting all that time is kind of annoying,

12
00:00:35,972 --> 00:00:37,240
and if I think about it,

13
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,060
there's no real reason to wait until the end of the program to print the article chain.

14
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,955
Charlie and I planned it that way,

15
00:00:42,954 --> 00:00:44,899
but now that I see the results in front of me,

16
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:47,780
I think it would be better if we printed the articles as they were visited.

17
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,844
I'll make that quick change with a command line text editor.

18
00:00:50,844 --> 00:00:52,804
You can also use your standard text editor.

19
00:00:52,804 --> 00:00:55,030
First, I'll remove this print statement from the end of

20
00:00:55,030 --> 00:01:00,060
the program and I'll put a new print statement in the while loop.

21
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:05,055
Let's save this change and test it. Here we go.

22
00:01:05,055 --> 00:01:07,010
So it starts with a random article,

23
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,950
then Karnataka, and here it goes.

24
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,030
Cool. I think this is a lot more fun to watch. All right.

25
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,439
The program works. You can find the completed version of this program below this video.
