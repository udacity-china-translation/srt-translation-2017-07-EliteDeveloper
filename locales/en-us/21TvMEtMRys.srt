1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,745
We have our local repository down here and a remote repository up here.

2
00:00:05,745 --> 00:00:10,250
Our local repository has these commits on the master branch,

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:13,574
but the remote repository is completely empty.

4
00:00:13,574 --> 00:00:19,939
Now, how do we get these commits from our local repository up into the remote repository?

5
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,790
We can do that with the git push command.

6
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:25,894
That will take all of the commits from the local repository

7
00:00:25,894 --> 00:00:30,000
and send or push them up to the remote.
