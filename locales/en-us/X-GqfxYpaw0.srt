1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,830
I tried the new and improved link extraction code,

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:06,490
on this article by Yoshiharu Yamaguchi.

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:10,650
I expected the extraction code to find this link to Osaka, but instead,

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,576
it found this little question mark which is actually a link

5
00:00:13,576 --> 00:00:16,649
to the Wikipedia page about Japanese character sets.

6
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:19,854
Technically, beautiful suit found the right link.

7
00:00:19,855 --> 00:00:22,859
But once again, this is not what I really want.

8
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:25,294
The same behavior can lead to other bugs too.

9
00:00:25,295 --> 00:00:29,545
If the first link in the article is a link to a footnote or a citation for example,

10
00:00:29,545 --> 00:00:31,925
that's what the link extractor will find.

11
00:00:31,925 --> 00:00:33,465
What we really want to do though,

12
00:00:33,465 --> 00:00:36,400
is to find what first linked us to an ordinary Wikipedia article,

13
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,000
not to a help page. How can we do that?
