00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,769
Welcome back. You've already met some of Python's data types and built-in functions.

2
00:00:04,769 --> 00:00:08,214
Now, you'll take the next step towards competent Python programming.

3
00:00:08,214 --> 00:00:09,794
You will define your own functions,

4
00:00:09,794 --> 00:00:12,410
install Python, and use conditionals and iterate.

5
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,274
We'll point out good Python programming practices along the way.
