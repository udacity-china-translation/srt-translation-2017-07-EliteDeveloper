1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,589
Now that we have defined the problem we're trying to solve,

2
00:00:02,589 --> 00:00:05,269
gotten familiar with the libraries you want to use and I've broken

3
00:00:05,269 --> 00:00:08,769
the problem down into smaller pieces, we can begin coding.

4
00:00:08,769 --> 00:00:10,769
There's another benefit to all this planning,

5
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:13,612
because we have defined the different pieces of our program,

6
00:00:13,612 --> 00:00:15,809
we can split up the work between us.

7
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,495
Since there's two of us, I think it makes sense to split the work into two major pieces.

8
00:00:19,495 --> 00:00:22,260
Yeah. I'll work on writing the main loop.

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,005
This part of the code will manage the article chain,

10
00:00:25,004 --> 00:00:27,044
limits how quickly we make requests,

11
00:00:27,045 --> 00:00:28,620
and print the output of the call.

12
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,039
And override the code that actually makes the requests and find the links.

13
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:35,339
Defining each piece will help us to collaborate,

14
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,220
but we might need to be flexible if things happen that we weren't expecting.

15
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:42,000
I'll get started with the continue call function.
