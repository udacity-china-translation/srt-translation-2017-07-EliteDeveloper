00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,935
We've used several useful string methods so far,

2
00:00:02,935 --> 00:00:04,474
but where did they come from?

3
00:00:04,474 --> 00:00:08,589
You can learn which methods the different types offer in Python's official documentation.

4
00:00:08,589 --> 00:00:11,144
Here's the count method we just used.

5
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:16,160
Notice how the documentation mentions two optional arguments, start and end.

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,329
You can use these to limit the counts to occurrences

7
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:20,954
that appear within specified sections of a string.

8
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:22,754
Throughout the documentation,

9
00:00:22,754 --> 00:00:26,160
optional arguments are indicated with square brackets like these.

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,274
Any arguments surrounded by square brackets are optional.

11
00:00:29,274 --> 00:00:31,834
The documentation tends to be terse and precise,

12
00:00:31,835 --> 00:00:33,960
but it's your most valuable resource.

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,399
Don't be afraid to use it.

14
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,759
Try out some of the other string methods that are listed in the documentation.

15
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:41,369
I've included a link to this section of the docs below this video.
