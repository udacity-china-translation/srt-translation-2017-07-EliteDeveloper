1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
Let's say this repository exists with

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,890
three commits and the master branches pointing at the last commit that was made.

3
00:00:06,889 --> 00:00:11,824
Now, one thing to note: the orientation of these commits doesn't really matter here.

4
00:00:11,824 --> 00:00:14,724
Typically I've been showing them as going horizontally,

5
00:00:14,724 --> 00:00:16,859
but I had to switch them to a vertical so that I could

6
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:19,945
display all of the necessary information.

7
00:00:19,945 --> 00:00:21,655
Now, this repository isn't ours.

8
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:23,310
It's some other developer's.

9
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:25,625
So we decide to fork it.

10
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,859
Remember that when you fork a repository,

11
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:30,079
you create an identical copy.

12
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:31,459
So these two repositories will have

13
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,674
the exact same commits and their branches will be pointing at the same commits.

14
00:00:35,674 --> 00:00:39,848
Now to create a poll request we need some new commits in our fork.

15
00:00:39,848 --> 00:00:42,934
So we clone our fork down to our local machine.

16
00:00:42,935 --> 00:00:48,020
Let's create a bug fix branch and make a few commits to clean things up.

17
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,830
Now let's push the bug fix branch back to our fork to

18
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:56,140
get these new commits up on our remote repository.

19
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,049
We've done all the prep work now needed for

20
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:00,824
a pull request by pushing changes to our fork,

21
00:01:00,825 --> 00:01:04,075
and now is when we'd actually create a pull request.

22
00:01:04,075 --> 00:01:06,859
We'll look at how to do this on GitHub in just a second.

23
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:10,929
If the pull request is accepted by the original repository's maintainer,

24
00:01:10,929 --> 00:01:13,924
the commits will be added to their repository.

25
00:01:13,924 --> 00:01:17,700
A merge commit will be created combining our new commits with

26
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,100
their existing commits and

27
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:24,000
their master branch will move to point to this new merged commit.
