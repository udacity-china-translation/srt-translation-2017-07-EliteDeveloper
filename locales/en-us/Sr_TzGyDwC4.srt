00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,345
Welcome back. Well done your work on the lab.

2
00:00:03,345 --> 00:00:05,580
I hope you found out some interesting things about

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,175
the calling and texting habits of the users in that data set.

4
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:12,500
The lab should have tested a lot of what you've already learned about Python.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,820
Next, we're going to build upon that knowledge.

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,344
You will get acquainted with tuples and learn more about writing functions.

7
00:00:18,344 --> 00:00:21,839
We'll also show you how to read from files and how to leverage the power of

8
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:25,679
the community by importing and using Python modules and libraries.

9
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:27,429
I say, we should get going.

10
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:29,000
Yes. Enjoy.
