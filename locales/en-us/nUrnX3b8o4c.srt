00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,450
Now that the move function is available on every single car and

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,939
has been rewritten to use the keyword this.

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:07,939
It's somewhat hard to imagine a use for

4
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:10,450
storing it in the global variable, like move.

5
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:14,260
Let's take the code for that method out of this area in the global scope and

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,710
move it right into the decorator function.

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,360
Take a moment to refactor this library function.

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,230
So that the move method's code exists within the carlike decorator.
