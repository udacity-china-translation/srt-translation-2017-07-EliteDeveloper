1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,570
So the final change we're going to make, is thinking about our

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,600
random surfer model. If this was our model, if a page has

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,880
no incoming links, well, it's popularity ranking would be 0. We

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,540
don't want to have that be the case. If we think of

5
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,220
our random web surfer, well if she randomly starts at a

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,240
page, she could randomly start at a page that has no links.

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,060
If we made all the page scores 0, for pages with no

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,610
links, well, then it would be very hard for a new page

9
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,710
to get started. So, we don't want those to be 0,

10
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,400
so we're going to have some random probability that you reach a

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,490
page even when it has no links. So that means we're going to

12
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:37,180
add something to this sum so it's not zero when there are

13
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,800
no incoming links. And the other thing we're going to do

14
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,840
is we're going to scale this summation a little bit. And we're

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,560
going to scale that with what is called the damping function. And

16
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,080
that just means, if we think of our random web surfer again,

17
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,300
even if she's following a path. That does have more

18
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,000
links. At some point, she might decide to get tired and

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,570
give up and start again with a new random page. So,

20
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,710
the dampening function determines how frequently, we think our random web

21
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:06,840
surfer will pick a random link, versus starting over again

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,070
on a new random page. So that's call the dampening value

23
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,110
and we are just going to use the dampening value to scale

24
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,660
this number. So, we'll call that d, that's the dampening constant.

25
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,610
A typical value for that is something less than one,

26
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,980
and a good value is something like 0.8. So now we're

27
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,430
going to change our rank function to take into account that. We're

28
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,510
going to have some initial value and if we want to keep the

29
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:32,590
values in a reasonable range, instead of starting from one,

30
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,790
we're going to divide the values by a total number of pages.

31
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,210
And the reason for that is just to keep the ranks

32
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:41,750
in some meaningful range. This will keep the ranks so the

33
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,520
total of the ranks when we start the sum of the

34
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,400
ranks is 1, that gives them a little more meaning then if

35
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,600
the sum of the ranks was the number of pages. So

36
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,230
n is going to be the number of pages, the total number

37
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:56,150
in our corpus and d is the damping constant, and so

38
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:00,770
now we're going to change our initial values to divide them by n.

39
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,500
This means, the sum of the page ranks at the beginning will

40
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,970
be 1, and, we're going to change the way we compute the rank

41
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,190
by adding to it, a value that correspo... That gives

42
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,350
us the sense of starting over. So, the value that we're

43
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,970
going to use for this is 1 minus d, divided by n

44
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,890
and, that gives the notion that. That times when we don't

45
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,480
decide to do a new page. So, 0.8 of the

46
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,800
time. We decide to follow a new page. So we're going to

47
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,920
multiply this by D. The times when we don't follow a

48
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,120
new page, that's one minus D. We're going to start over, and

49
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,340
we're going to divide that by N, because N is the

50
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,080
number of pages that the probability that this is the page

51
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,060
that would be picked when we start over. So now we've

52
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,740
got our recursive definition of page rank. We start by initializing

53
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,200
the rank n times at 0 to one minus, divided by

54
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,130
N, and then for as many times up, as we want,

55
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,820
we're going to keep improving our results. By using this formula. For

56
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:59,570
each link that links to us, we're going to take it's popularity

57
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:02,030
on the last step, divide that by the number of out

58
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,290
links so it's dividing it by the number of other pages it

59
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:09,290
links to. Multiply that by our damping constant and that gives

60
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:13,020
the probability that this page was selected by the Random Web Surfer,

61
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,520
and then we're going to add the term that takes into

62
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,680
account the Random Web Server might have started over from scratch and

63
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,800
picked a new random page. So, before we try to change

64
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,730
our Web search engine to actually program this, it's time for a

65
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:30,960
little quiz. And the quiz is, What is AltaVista? And if you don't know this,

66
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:37,340
feel free to use Google, or DuckDuckGo, to find out. These are the choices so,

67
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,250
it's the view from the Udacity headquarters

68
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,590
in Palo Alto. It's the most popular web

69
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:45,740
search engine in 1998. It is Spanish for,

70
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:49,930
You're Terminated Baby and, it's a small town

71
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:53,740
in Virginia. And feel free to Google the answer if you don't know.
