00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,920
So notice back in our diagram that the object that has the dot loc property,

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,990
each of these car objects in our program has not

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:10,430
been generated from whole cloth anymore.

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:12,710
We passed it through a decorator function.

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:13,860
And when it came back out,

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,830
it was given the dot loc property, pointing to whatever value it has.

7
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:22,120
Decorators can add more than just simple properties like this number.

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,410
Remember, functions are properties too.

9
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:28,870
Maybe we'd prefer to call the Move Function using method calling syntax,

10
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:33,780
which means we would look it up as a property of Amy before invoking it on Amy.

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,160
If we want to do this, we're going to have to re-factor our code again.

12
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,650
So take a moment to re-factor this code in a way that would enable us to

13
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,730
use this method calling syntax with dot access
