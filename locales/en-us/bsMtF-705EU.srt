00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,254
I'll test the link extraction code on this article about PICALM,

2
00:00:03,254 --> 00:00:04,995
which is a protein, apparently.

3
00:00:04,995 --> 00:00:07,050
I'll go through the process of downloading and

4
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:09,434
soupifying the HTML again with this article.

5
00:00:09,435 --> 00:00:13,060
Using the up key on my keyboard saves me a lot of time.

6
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:17,535
Hmm. So the first link in the article is to the protein article,

7
00:00:17,535 --> 00:00:21,175
but our code found the sling to geneontology.org.

8
00:00:21,175 --> 00:00:23,190
What went wrong? Let's think about it.

9
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:42,176
It took me a few minutes of searching,

10
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:45,519
but I eventually found the geneontology link here in the sidebar.

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,885
When I look at this anchor tag in the developer tools,

12
00:00:47,884 --> 00:00:53,869
I see that it's part of a paragraph and that paragraph is part of the div we care about.

13
00:00:53,869 --> 00:00:56,159
This is technically what we asked Beautiful Soup for,

14
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:57,839
but this isn't the link we want.

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,270
Let's look at the link we do want,

16
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:04,490
protein, so we can guess why Beautiful Soup didn't find it.

17
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:10,689
OK. So the protein link is inside of a paragraph tag,

18
00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:11,926
and the paragraph tag,

19
00:01:11,926 --> 00:01:13,570
if we scroll up far enough,

20
00:01:13,569 --> 00:01:15,939
is also inside of the content div.

21
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:20,709
But this protein link comes farther down the HTML document than the infobox does.

22
00:01:20,709 --> 00:01:22,000
So even though the infobox is

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,043
a distant descendant of the div compared to the protein link,

24
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,989
Beautiful Soup found it first.

25
00:01:26,989 --> 00:01:30,184
It seems like this problem is more complicated than we assumed.

26
00:01:30,185 --> 00:01:33,204
We're not just looking for the first link in the first paragraph,

27
00:01:33,204 --> 00:01:36,069
we're looking for the first link that's in the first paragraph

28
00:01:36,069 --> 00:01:39,614
that isn't also part of an infobox or something weird like that.

29
00:01:39,614 --> 00:01:41,844
Let's go back to the Beautiful Soup documentation

30
00:01:41,844 --> 00:01:44,140
and see if there is any mention of a situation like this.
