1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,310
Next, you'll practice reading and trying to

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,919
understand Python code that's already been written.

3
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:07,019
Whenever you're programming, you need to think about

4
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:09,719
the future readers and maintainers of the code you're writing.

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,870
In this section, you won't change what the code does,

6
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:15,914
but you'll first try to understand it in its current state,

7
00:00:15,914 --> 00:00:19,484
then you'll make it easy to use, read and maintain.

8
00:00:19,484 --> 00:00:23,725
Reading and refactoring code are important skills for Python programmer.

9
00:00:23,725 --> 00:00:25,836
What do you mean by refactoring, Charlie?

10
00:00:25,836 --> 00:00:31,195
Factoring is another word for decomposing a complex problem into simpler parts.

11
00:00:31,195 --> 00:00:33,855
You practiced that earlier on this course durating problem.

12
00:00:33,854 --> 00:00:39,529
Refactoring just means doing this decomposition process on code that already exists.

13
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,384
It's like reorganizing the workshop.

14
00:00:41,384 --> 00:00:46,240
To work efficiently, you need to tidy up so you can find each tool as you need it.

15
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,030
In general, keeping you on top of

16
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,620
the organization of your code will make it easier to maintain.

17
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:53,000
You'll thank yourself later.
