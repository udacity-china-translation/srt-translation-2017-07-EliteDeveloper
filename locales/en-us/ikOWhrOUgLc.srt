00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
Welcome back. The next topic we'll explore is data structures.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,849
So far, our programs have dealt with individual integers, floats and strings.

3
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:11,490
Now, we'll see how we can store collections of data.

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,570
We'll also learn how to iterate through collections of data with loops.

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,060
Along the way, we'll learn about refactoring,

6
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:19,979
another software engineering skill.

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,219
Enjoy and happy Python programming.
