00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,330
While you and Charlie have been working on the main loop,

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,575
I've been working on the find_first_link function.

3
00:00:04,575 --> 00:00:07,710
This collaboration wouldn't be possible if we hadn't planned things out ahead

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,105
of time and broken the collar down into smaller parts.

5
00:00:11,105 --> 00:00:13,230
Beyond that though, Charlie had to specify

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,054
how her code would use the find_first_link function.

7
00:00:16,054 --> 00:00:18,625
Charlie will call the function by passing it a string.

8
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:21,420
I don't know what variable names Charlie defined in her part of the program,

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,630
so I'll just refer to this function's input as URL.

10
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:27,778
The function does its work and returns another string.

11
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:32,019
The return value is the first link from the article that was passed into the function.

12
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,990
This specification is like a contract between Charlie and me.

13
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:38,775
If the article provides the correct argument as my code returns the correct result,

14
00:00:38,774 --> 00:00:44,195
then our program will work correctly.

15
00:00:44,195 --> 00:00:48,439
Likewise, I can implement the function however I like and Charlie doesn't have to

16
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:50,449
worry about how it'll fit into her code because we've

17
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,000
already agreed on how her code will call the function.
