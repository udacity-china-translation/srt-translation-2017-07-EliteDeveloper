00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,724
This is a very important thing to understand when starting to work with branches.

2
00:00:04,724 --> 00:00:09,330
If content is stored on one branch and their commits on another branch,

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,365
those other commits are invisible until we switch to that other branch.

4
00:00:13,365 --> 00:00:16,379
When we switch, then we'll see those commits.

5
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,369
But the original commits will no longer appear in our code editor.

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:24,570
They aren't lost. They're just not displaying since we've checked out a different branch.
