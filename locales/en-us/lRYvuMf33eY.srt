1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,815
We've come all the way to the end.

2
00:00:01,815 --> 00:00:03,389
Well done for all of your hard work.

3
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:05,334
You've learned about types,

4
00:00:05,334 --> 00:00:09,214
methods, functions, data structures and much more.

5
00:00:09,214 --> 00:00:11,789
You've had practice writing your own code and seeing lots of

6
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:16,019
examples from short one-liners to the big case study about Wikipedia.

7
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:20,074
We think you're ready to start using Python in the real world.

8
00:00:20,074 --> 00:00:23,515
Don't forget what you've learned about breaking problems into steps,

9
00:00:23,515 --> 00:00:25,890
looking up documentation and testing your code.

10
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,563
Wherever it may take you next,

11
00:00:27,562 --> 00:00:29,269
enjoy coding in Python.
