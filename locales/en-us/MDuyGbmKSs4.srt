Great job.

2
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,500
At this point we're completely done with our exploration of

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,920
different versions of the object decorator pattern.

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,370
Generally, you would use the decorator pattern to add some functionality to

5
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:13,160
an object that already had some functionality in it at that point.

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,329
But our example is so simple that we just find ourselves passing in

7
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:18,330
an empty object to the carlike decorator.
