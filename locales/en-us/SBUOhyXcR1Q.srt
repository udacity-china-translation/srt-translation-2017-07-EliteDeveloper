00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
Hello and welcome to this course on GitHub

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,870
and how to collaborate on a version control project.

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:09,179
Let's chat briefly about collaboration and why it's so important.

4
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:12,685
I mean, it's got to be important if we're creating an entire course on it.

5
00:00:12,685 --> 00:00:15,990
Well, collaboration is incredibly beneficial because most of

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,254
the time you won't be working by yourself as a lone developer on a project.

7
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:21,765
You'll be working with a team,

8
00:00:21,765 --> 00:00:23,594
maybe with people you don't even know,

9
00:00:23,594 --> 00:00:26,554
or maybe you're contributing to an open-source project.

10
00:00:26,553 --> 00:00:30,119
So being able to work collaboratively is a vital skill to have,

11
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,810
but it's especially important when you're working on a coding project.

12
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,990
One of the key aspects of collaboration is being able to communicate

13
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,277
clearly what you're doing and being able to work with others,

14
00:00:40,277 --> 00:00:41,774
like the project's maintainers,

15
00:00:41,774 --> 00:00:43,969
to see how you can contribute.

16
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:48,844
This communication can be kind of tricky when working remotely and asynchronously.

17
00:00:48,844 --> 00:00:49,993
After going through this course,

18
00:00:49,993 --> 00:00:53,144
you'll be able to work with others on a version control project,

19
00:00:53,145 --> 00:00:58,289
use GitHub and its features to plan changes and implement those changes,

20
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:00,719
contribute to an existing repository,

21
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,867
and then how to add features to a project while it's in active development.

22
00:01:04,867 --> 00:01:06,030
And if you're taking this course,

23
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,709
then I'm expecting you to already have

24
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:12,025
a pretty solid experience with version control and specifically with Git.

25
00:01:12,025 --> 00:01:16,140
I've got a list of skills that I expect you to be comfortable with below this video.

26
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,680
Now if you're new to Git and version control in general, don't worry.

27
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,750
I've created a course called "Version Control with

28
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,435
Git" that will bring you up to speed on everything you need to know.

29
00:01:25,435 --> 00:01:27,144
A link to that course is below.

30
00:01:27,144 --> 00:01:31,530
So, the first thing we need to look at before we get into GitHub, collaboration,

31
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,680
or anything else is understanding what a remote repository is and how to work with one.

32
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,280
So, let's check that out now.
