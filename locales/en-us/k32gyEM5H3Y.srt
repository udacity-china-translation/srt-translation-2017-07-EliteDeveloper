1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,100
So now that you've survived the bunny uprising, we're ready to

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,470
get to the main goal of this class, as far as building

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:09,090
the search engine. Our goal is to improve the results by finding

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,670
the web page instead of just returning a list of all the

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,830
web pages that match a query. As the web page grown, it's

6
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:18,040
become more and more important for search engines to do this ranking

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,410
well. That what really distinguished Google

8
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,250
from previous search engines was they

9
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,270
had a much smarter way of ranking pages that produced more useful

10
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,600
results, where the first one or two results in response

11
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,980
to a search query were often the very thing that

12
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,650
the user was searching for. So now we're ready to

13
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,780
start thinking about the problem of how to rank web

14
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,340
pages. Let's start by recapping how our search engine works.

15
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,950
So we started by building a crawler. And what the

16
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:46,505
crawler did, and this is what we did in units

17
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:50,270
one, two, and three, what the crawler did was follow all

18
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:55,480
the links in the web pages. Following those links, building up an index.

19
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:01,400
And the end result of the crawler, after units four

20
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:06,260
and five was we had an index. By the end

21
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,530
of unit five, it was a, a table where we could look up a keyword,

22
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,400
and we would find the entry where that

23
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,690
keyword might appear. And we'd follow, and we

24
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,800
could look through each of those entries to find the one

25
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,500
that matched, and that would match the keyword that we

26
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,050
were looking for. And as it's value, it would have a

27
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:28,430
list of all the urls where that keyword appears. And the

28
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:32,130
order of those urls in that list was determined just by

29
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,850
how we added them to the crawl. Everytime we encountered

30
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:38,200
new page, we indexed that page, and we added a url

31
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,920
for that keyword. So the one that's first in this list is

32
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,590
just the one that we happen to find first. So

33
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,520
say it's the c page. The one that's second would be

34
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,270
the one that we find next. And it's this page. So,

35
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:53,690
this doesn't tell us anything about which page is best. So

36
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,160
the order of the URLs in the list and what we

37
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,300
were getting as our output just depends on the order that

38
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,770
things happen to go in the crawl. When the web was

39
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,030
really small, which was quite a while ago now, this was

40
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,330
sort of okay. That there were only a few pages that

41
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,030
might match a given keyword, and you could look through them

42
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,110
all and decide which one you wanted. With the web today,

43
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,890
this doesn't work at all. There are thousands of pages that

44
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:23,070
match any interesting keyword. Maybe millions. Certainly many more than you

45
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:26,000
want to look through by hand. So the most important thing

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,630
that a good search engine does is to figure out how

47
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:31,040
to rank these pages so the one that's at the front of

48
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,710
the list is the one the user wants. So that's our goal for

49
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,970
the rest of this unit, to figure out how to rank pages. Before

50
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:43,370
we do this for web pages, we're going to do something very similar, but

51
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,710
perhaps easier to relate to. We're going to

52
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,560
talk about how we decide who's popular.
