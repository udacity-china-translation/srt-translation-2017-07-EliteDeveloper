00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
Nice work. You've now installed Python,

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,560
written complete programs and run them on your own computer.

3
00:00:05,559 --> 00:00:10,059
You learned how to define functions and how to write code with branches.

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,300
You also practiced your software engineering skills by

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,480
breaking a complicated problem down into smaller pieces.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,149
Next, you'll learn about Python's data structures for storing collections of data.

7
00:00:20,149 --> 00:00:23,669
We'll discuss iteration using for loops and while loops.

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,480
We'll spend some time working on code organization skills too. See you soon.
