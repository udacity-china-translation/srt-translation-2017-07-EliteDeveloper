1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
You've learned a lot of Python so far.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,679
You know how to represent numerical and text data and you know

3
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:09,529
how historic collections of data and lists sets and dictionaries.

4
00:00:09,529 --> 00:00:13,059
Yes, you've collected a set of tools for working with data.

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,160
You can use Python's built-in methods and

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,160
functions and you can write functions of your own.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,780
You can iterate with loops and make conditional decisions with if and else.

8
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,476
With these tools, you can solve most programming problems.

9
00:00:26,475 --> 00:00:28,599
Sure, there's more to Python than all we've covered

10
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,355
so far and we'll get to more topics later on.

11
00:00:31,355 --> 00:00:33,158
But now, it's time to apply this course you've

12
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:35,850
learned so you can practice the craft of programming.

13
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,145
That's right. Programming is more than just syntax.

14
00:00:39,145 --> 00:00:42,095
To solve a problem you need to define it first.

15
00:00:42,094 --> 00:00:44,320
For example, you'll need to think about inputs to

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,560
the program and the results that you should give as output.

17
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,570
Once you thought through the goals of your program,

18
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:53,679
you need to think about how to break the program down into smaller pieces.

19
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,744
Then, you need to evaluate your plan to make sure it solves the original problem.

20
00:00:57,744 --> 00:01:00,039
I often find that when I plan a new program,

21
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:02,875
I realize that the problem is more complicated than I had assumed.

22
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:06,689
Planning before coding, helps me understand the problem better.

23
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:09,870
There are other things to keep in mind when you do begin coding.

24
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,189
You want to write some test cases so that you

25
00:01:12,189 --> 00:01:15,034
can check that your code does what it's supposed to do.

26
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:17,468
You also need to make your code readable.

27
00:01:17,468 --> 00:01:21,089
If your code is so complicated that you could only just understand it,

28
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,460
as you write it, you have no hope of understanding it later on.

29
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,954
Before we move on to the next topics,

30
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:29,920
there will be a lab that lets you practice these skills.

31
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,587
Good luck. As you work,

32
00:01:31,587 --> 00:01:33,895
remember to break problems into smaller pieces,

33
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:38,000
to plan, and to focus on readability. We'll see you soon.
