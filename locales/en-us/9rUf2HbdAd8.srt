00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,150
Awesome work! You've made it to the end of this section on reviewing existing commits.

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,009
Remember, that being able to display

3
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:12,550
a repository's history can be especially helpful when you're first starting out.

4
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,464
It's beneficial to know what's being stored in a commit,

5
00:00:15,464 --> 00:00:18,570
and how to view it after the commit is made.

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,240
You know, we keep talking about commits and have been

7
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:23,609
reviewing all of these existing commits,

8
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:26,789
I think it's time we actually make our first commit. What do you think?

9
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:28,318
In the next lesson,

10
00:00:28,318 --> 00:00:30,105
you'll learn about making commits,

11
00:00:30,105 --> 00:00:33,268
viewing a file's changes before the commit is made,

12
00:00:33,268 --> 00:00:36,000
telling it to not track specific files and more.
