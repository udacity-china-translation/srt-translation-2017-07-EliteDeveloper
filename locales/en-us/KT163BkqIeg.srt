1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,365
In the last lesson we looked at some of the common terms used in version control systems.

2
00:00:05,365 --> 00:00:07,650
You also install GIT on your computer and did

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:11,220
some initial configuration of GIT like adding your name and email.

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,260
If you skip these steps it's probably

5
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:16,320
a good idea to go back and check them out again before continuing.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,605
In this lesson we'll be learning how to create our own GIT repositories.

7
00:00:20,605 --> 00:00:23,629
I mean we can't really do anything without having a repo to work with.

8
00:00:23,629 --> 00:00:26,934
Oh and "repo" is just short for repository,

9
00:00:26,934 --> 00:00:28,588
does mean exactly the same thing,

10
00:00:28,588 --> 00:00:30,809
so I'll be using them interchangeably.

11
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:33,920
Remember to keep the list of terms nearby as a reference.

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,829
We'll be looking at three GIT commands in this lesson.

13
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:40,140
GIT init, GIT clone and GIT status.

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,615
With GIT init, you'll create brand new repositories from scratch on your computer.

15
00:00:44,615 --> 00:00:47,789
With GIT clone, you'll clone or copy

16
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:52,254
an existing repo from somewhere else to your local computer.

17
00:00:52,255 --> 00:00:56,335
You'll also learn how vitally important it is to know the status of a repo.

18
00:00:56,335 --> 00:01:00,570
You'll learn to check the status of a repo with the GIT status command.

19
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,670
Three simple commands but they're starting us

20
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,310
on our journey towards version control mastery.

21
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,000
Let's get going with GIT init.
