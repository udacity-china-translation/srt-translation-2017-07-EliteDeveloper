1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,870
So your goal for this quiz, is to define

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:05,640
a procedure, named factorial, that takes a number, which is

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,189
a positive whole number as its input, and outputs the

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:12,070
number of ways to arrange the input number of items.

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,950
So, that's the mathematical definition of factorial. And, for your

6
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,215
procedure, we've already seen how to do this using a

7
00:00:18,215 --> 00:00:21,230
while loop. Your goal here is to define that procedure without

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,930
using a while loop, to define it as a recursive definition.
