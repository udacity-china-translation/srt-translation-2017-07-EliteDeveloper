00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,919
All right. In lesson one,

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:04,740
we figured out how to work with remote repositories.

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,179
In lesson two, we looked at how to start developing on a shared repository.

4
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:12,330
Now, let's look at how to sync our new changes back to

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,189
our forked remote repository and how to

6
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:17,429
retrieve updates from the original source repository.

7
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:19,379
Some things we'll look at in this lesson are,

8
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:22,928
learning what a pull request is and how to make one,

9
00:00:22,928 --> 00:00:24,789
retrieving updates that have been made in

10
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:28,140
the source repository and including them in our fork,

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,870
working with an active pull request,

12
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,600
squashing commits with git rebase and more.

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,300
Let's start out by looking what a pull request is and how to create one.
