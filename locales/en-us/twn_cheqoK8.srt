1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
We finally reached the end.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,704
Can you believe it?

3
00:00:03,704 --> 00:00:06,935
Think back to your former self when you first started this course.

4
00:00:06,934 --> 00:00:08,247
The new and improved you,

5
00:00:08,247 --> 00:00:10,114
now has Git superpowers.

6
00:00:10,115 --> 00:00:14,720
You can create a GIT repository from scratch, make commits,

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,890
review the history of a repository, develop on branches,

8
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,844
merge branches together and handle any merge conflicts,

9
00:00:21,844 --> 00:00:24,849
and then revert and reset commits.

10
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:29,130
Git and version control in general can be a challenging skill to acquire.

11
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:30,589
But now you've done it.

12
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:32,570
Congratulations.

13
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,000
