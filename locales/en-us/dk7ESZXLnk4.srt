00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,860
When I'm working with a new library,

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,294
I like to try it out in the interactive shell.

3
00:00:04,294 --> 00:00:07,529
This is the fastest way to try out its methods in syntax.

4
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,539
I have opened the Beautiful Soup Documentation besides

5
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:12,660
my terminal so I can reference it as I try it out.

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,289
The documentation has it's convenient quick start guide that we can follow along with.

7
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:20,189
Let's start at the Python interpreter and import Beautiful Soup.

8
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,850
The documentation suggests we import the library with this line

9
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:26,385
here from bs4 import BeautifulSoup.

10
00:00:26,385 --> 00:00:30,670
Next, the documentation shows how to create a soup object from a string.

11
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,515
The quick start guide uses a small html sample that's in a string.

12
00:00:34,515 --> 00:00:37,250
I've always thought though that I learn best when I don't follow some instructions

13
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,969
exactly so I think I'll make a soup object out of a Wikipedia's html source instead.

14
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:46,289
Charlie showed us how to get an html string with requests so we'll do that here.

15
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:50,509
I'll get Wikipedia's main page and store it source in a variable called html.

16
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:53,504
Let's verify that we got the html.

17
00:00:53,505 --> 00:00:56,265
Whoa, that's a lot of html.

18
00:00:56,265 --> 00:01:00,099
Now, let's make it into a soup object using these instructions from the documentation.

19
00:01:00,098 --> 00:01:08,750
The quick start guide suggests that we get the title tag like this.

20
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:12,094
Okay, that works.

21
00:01:12,094 --> 00:01:14,929
Good. Let's try getting a paragraph tag.

22
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:19,498
The documentation says we can do that with soup.p.

23
00:01:19,498 --> 00:01:22,484
OK. This is a lot of html again,

24
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:24,554
but at least it's just one paragraph.

25
00:01:24,555 --> 00:01:29,030
I'll open Wikipedia in my browser to compare this to what the browser displays.

26
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,670
It looks like today's featured articles about Frost's bolete,

27
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:36,200
a type of fungus, and that's the same paragraph we got from Beautiful Soup. Great.

28
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,999
If you want the first instance of a paragraph tag on a page, we use soup.p.

29
00:01:40,998 --> 00:01:45,622
We can get nested tags like this, soup.p.a.

30
00:01:45,623 --> 00:01:50,469
This selects the first anchor tag inside of the first paragraph tag.

31
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:53,420
In this case, it's a link to the featured article.

32
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,519
The rest of this quick start guide shows how to get

33
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,189
lists of anchor tags instead of just one tag.

34
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:01,459
Install Beautiful Soup, open up the documentation in the terminal,

35
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:03,140
and try this out for yourself.
