1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,944
At its core, git records changes to files as commits.

2
00:00:03,944 --> 00:00:06,599
These commits are all saved in a repository.

3
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:09,359
Everything else, things like the working directory branches and

4
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:13,349
SHAs are there to help make and reference commits.

5
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:18,239
As you've seen the terminology that version control uses is kind of cryptic at first.

6
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:20,579
Hopefully you had the hand out with you and reviewed it as you

7
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:23,594
went through the high level overview of how git it is used.

8
00:00:23,594 --> 00:00:27,204
In the next section we're going to install and configure git.

9
00:00:27,204 --> 00:00:29,159
Make sure to follow each of the steps in order

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,070
so that your computer will be configured like mine.

11
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,530
Now, configuring your terminal isn't required

12
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,594
for git to work correctly or to continue with this course.

13
00:00:37,594 --> 00:00:39,933
You can do the entire course without this step,

14
00:00:39,933 --> 00:00:42,794
but not only does it make it easier to use,

15
00:00:42,795 --> 00:00:45,260
all professionals reconfigure their terminal.

16
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:47,820
The reconfiguration we'll be doing will add color to

17
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,975
the terminal and display specific git information.

18
00:00:50,975 --> 00:00:53,000
Sounds good. Let's get to it.
