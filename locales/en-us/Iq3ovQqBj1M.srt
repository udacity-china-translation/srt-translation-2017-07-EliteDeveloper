1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,865
I'll calculate the average of these numbers by adding them up and dividing by three.

2
00:00:04,865 --> 00:00:07,589
I'll use the print function to see the result.

3
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:11,809
Hmm.

4
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:15,419
This is not what I expected. It's an error message.

5
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:16,614
It's a bit disappointing,

6
00:00:16,614 --> 00:00:20,134
but hopefully the error message will explain the issue.

7
00:00:20,135 --> 00:00:22,480
The bottom line says that I made

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,554
a syntax error and the caret points to the relevant line of the code.

9
00:00:27,554 --> 00:00:34,000
So, it looks like I made a typo and left out the first parenthesis in the call to print.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,829
I'll fix it and try again.

11
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:41,484
OK, good. It worked this time.

12
00:00:41,484 --> 00:00:45,659
Great. Fortunately, this error message was pretty straightforward.

13
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:47,529
This won't always be the case though.

14
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,185
Sometimes you'll get errors that are more difficult to read.

15
00:00:50,185 --> 00:00:51,795
They can still be helpful though.

16
00:00:51,795 --> 00:00:53,984
If you get an error that you don't understand,

17
00:00:53,984 --> 00:00:58,000
copy it into a search engine to get more information about what has happened.
