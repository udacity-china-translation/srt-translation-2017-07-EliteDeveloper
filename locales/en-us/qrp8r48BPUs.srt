00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,724
When you're coding, it's tempting to try writing a program that does everything.

2
00:00:04,724 --> 00:00:07,964
Typically, you'll be coding something that you thought was simple,

3
00:00:07,964 --> 00:00:10,150
and then a new idea arises.

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:11,259
You slide it right in,

5
00:00:11,259 --> 00:00:13,657
because it makes sense to you here and now.

6
00:00:13,657 --> 00:00:16,364
Before you know it, your code ends up very long,

7
00:00:16,364 --> 00:00:20,209
quite complicated, and basically impossible to debug.

8
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,339
You really don't want such a big code block.

9
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:26,894
Your program might be full of clever ideas and slick implementation,

10
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:29,189
but it's impossible to read and you simply can't

11
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,859
reuse all that great code somewhere else.

12
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:35,859
This is why it's important to plan your ideas before you start coding.

13
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:38,707
That one great idea you're trying to implement,

14
00:00:38,707 --> 00:00:42,339
it's almost certainly got several parts, multiple steps,

15
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,922
or different cases that can be split apart,

16
00:00:44,921 --> 00:00:47,064
worked on, and put back together again.

17
00:00:47,064 --> 00:00:50,189
Thinking about the pieces of the problem you're solving before

18
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:53,849
your fingers even touch the keyboard means you can lay plans,

19
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,240
split up the work, and plan how to test your code early on.

20
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,660
Let's try an example.
